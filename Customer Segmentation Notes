- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a proven marketing model for behavior based customer segmentation.

- RFM helps divide customers into various categories or clusters to identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions and also     for future personalization services.

- Valuing customers based on a single parameter is insufficient.

- That’s why, RFM model combines three different customer attributes to rank customers.

- If they bought in recent past, they get higher points. If they bought many times, they get higher score. And if they spent bigger, they get   more points. Combine these three scores to create the RFM score.

- Finally you can segment your customer database into different groups based on this Recency – Frequency – Monetary score.


% Instead of reaching out to 100% of your audience, you need to identify and target only specific customer groups that will turn out to be most profitable for your business -- Hence targeting is highly recommendable. 

- All marketing campaigns should pick up a target segment first, then create promotional material that will resonate with that audience, and     then put the pedal to the metal.
